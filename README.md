As an undergraduate research intern with The Natural Sciences and Enginering Council of Canaada, the project I am working on is building a nutrition website to assist immigrants in Canada with achieving their health and dietary goals by providing alternative ingredients and meals for them that remind them of back home but are even more nutritious. This work is currently in progress(JULY 2024).
